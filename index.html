        <p>Dublin has been in chaos for a while now, first the Morrigan tried to come back using some posh tin of tuna, then the void/madness and then the goddamn wall. Thebes is sounding like a nice holiday destination right about now. Yet, for some reason you're here. The wall separates the city in half and nobody on the outside knows exactly what is happening inside.<br />
        <img id="thebes" src="images/moving to sparta.gif" alt="Thebes looking like a better place than Dublin" width="400px"><br />
        You've heard rumours here and there, something about a cult? It's odd to think of that sort of thing happening just beyond the wall... But then again you have heard or seen some of the previous near world-ending events in the city so it kinda does make sense.<br />
        The wall stopped expanding three months ago after it took over half the city. The scientists still monitor it and experiment in an attempt to get Trinity campus back. Oh and of course, to guard the peace and save the poor souls trapped inside the wall. </p>
