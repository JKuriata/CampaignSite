        <h1>Grange Gorman Campus</h1>
        <p>The largest campus in Dublin, Grangegorman was constructed to accommodate for the increasing numbers of Scientific students moving to the city. Situated at the northern edge of the city and backing onto the city wall, this campus is under constant development. <br /><br>
        Home to a vast array of labs, testing sites, lecture halls and classrooms, this campus has long served as the main teaching location for Dublin’s Scientific community. Rivalling even <a href="https://jkuriata.github.io/CampaignSite/pages/locations/trinity.html">Trinity</a> for the knowledge in its archives, this sprawling set of buildings, parks and residences, is the new headquarters for the Scientists. Though most Students will complete their studies elsewhere, it is almost a given that an Irish Scientist will begin them here.<br /><br>
        Interspersed with green fields, copses of ash, oak and willow and a mix of old and new buildings, this campus is an oddity in the rigid nature of the scientists. Designed to make efficient use of the space, whilst allowing a flourishing culture of flora and fauna, the architectural layout of the campus integrates both ancient and modern techniques. <br /><br>
        The real treasure of Grangegorman however, can be found far below the soil. Here a sprawling network of ordered tunnels, caverns, bunkers and laboratories, is cleverly integrated into the old city, a place of great scientific power. Whilst most scientists never find themselves below the first 5 levels, the network continues down a full 9, and is carefully reinforced both manually and scientifically. These final floors are more often used for cutting edge experimentation and are closely monitored. <br /><br>
        Now the home of Science in Dublin, the campus was well equipped to house the large number of Scientists that fled Trinity prior to the expansion of the Wall. Despite this however, tensions have formed between the two groups, with many of the Trinity Scholars finding their current state of affairs “beneath them”. <br /> This has resulted in a partial segregation of the campus, a feat that has required an inordinate amount of reorganisation. The search for a solution to the problem of the Wall is ongoing and of top priority.</p>
